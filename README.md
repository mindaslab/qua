== Qua

Qua is a question and answer system like stack overflow. I developed it because I don't like the way stak treated me. All I want to do is to ask questions and get answers,thats it, but stack put in a lot of rules,gave mestuff like badges and blah blah which was totally unnecessary. So I am creating a question and answer system that does what I want.

This software will be available as free software, released under GPLV3 Licence. I use Ruby on Rails 3.2.1 to write this software.
